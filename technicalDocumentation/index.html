          Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.
          <br><br>Arch Linux should run on any x86_64-compatible machine with a minimum of 512 MiB RAM, though more memory is needed to boot the live system for installation. A basic installation should take less than 2 GiB of disk space. As the installation process needs to retrieve packages from a remote repository, this guide assumes a working internet connection is available.
        </p>

            <p>
              This turbo install guide makes a lot of assumptions on what you want and doesn't cover many real world setups. 
              <br>Always follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide" target="_blank">official wiki</a> if in doubt.

        <p>In this guide, the first SATA disk (<span>sda</span>) is used. On a modern computer, you may use <span>nvme0n1</span> or even <span>mmcblk0</span> on embedded systems.</p>
          <code>
            # cgdisk /dev/sda

        <p>Try to make it look something like:</p>
          <code class="print">

          </code>
        <p>
          The first partition will store the bootloader and the kernel, and will be read by the UEFI to boot. The second one will contain Arch.
          <br><br>Format the partitions and mount them.

          If Ethernet was plugged in during boot, it will be ready.
          <br>When plugging it after the fact, it's best to just reboot. Alternatively, run <span>dhcpcd</span>, <span>killall dhpcd</span> and run <span>dhcpcd</span> again to get an IP address. No, that didn't make sense, but it works way too well.

          <br><br>Unless some major hardware quirks are happening (damn you, NVIDIA!) you should be able to start using your computer now.
          <br>What to do now is heavily dependent on your hardware and desktop environment. A few common tips are provided.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Time</h2>
        <hr class="line">
        <p>Use the <span>timedatectl</span> tool.</p>
          <code>
            # timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Madrid
            # timedatectl set-ntp true
          </code>
            
        <h2>Sudo doesn't work</h2>
        <hr class="line">
        <p>
          It works, you are just not allowed to use it.
          <br>Login as root and edit <span>/etc/sudoers</span>.
        </p>
          <code>
            # nano /etc/sudoers

          </code>
            
        <h2>Bluetooth doesn't even exist</h2>
        <hr class="line">
        <p>
          Install <span>bluez</span> and <span>bluez-utils</span> and enable the service <span>systemctl enable --now bluetooth</span>.
          <br><br>Bluetooth audio needs <span>pulseaudio-bluetooth</span>.
          <br>When using a minimal desktop environment you can try some of the applets such as <span>blueman</span> or <span>gnome-bluetooth</span> to control it.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Audio in general</h2>
        <hr class="line">
        <p>
          Always install <span>pavucontrol</span> to completely manage your audio needs.
          <br><br>Mics by default come muted. Unmute it and/or boost it.
          <br>A similar deal happens with bluetooth audio, by default it runs on basically analog phone emulation mode. Change to high quality audio profile to not instantly die upon music playback.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Battery life is nonexistent</h2>
        <hr class="line">
        <p>
          The TLP daemon tunes tunables inside the heavily tunable Linux kernel so you have a semblance of battery life. You can also install it in normal desktops and it makes some difference in wall power draw.
          <br><br>Install <span>tlp</span> and enable it, which is quirky.
        </p>
          <code>
            # systemctl enable --now tlp
            # systemctl mask systemd-rfkill systemd-rfkill.socket

              Using partition names to boot instead of their unique identifiers will cause the OS not to boot if (when) the partition count or disk order of the computer changes.
              <br>It may change even across reboots. To avoid this issue, extract your partition's <span>PARTUUID</span> using <span>blkid</span> and edit your options line accordingly.

            <span class="material-icons">warning</span>
            <p>However, this doesn't really work on some laptops, which will just blackscreen or exhibit buggy behavior.Plus, it drains the battery pretty much instantly.</p>
          </div>
        <p>Install <span>bumblebee</span> so the integrated graphics have priority and activate its service:</p>
          <code>
            # systemctl enable bumblebeed
          </code>
        <p>You will need to add your user to the <span>bumblebee</span> group. Run:</p>
          <code>
            # gpasswd -a yourusername bumblebee
          </code>
        <p>
          To run programs with the NVIDIA card, run <span>optirun program</span>. For Steam games, change their executable command line to <span>optirun %command%</span>.
          <br><br>Finally, to allow the card to turn off completely when unused, install <span>bbswitch</span>.
        </p>
          <div class="alert danger">
            <span class="material-icons">highlight_off</span>
            <p>
              Even LESS laptops will like that. The workaround involves editing your kernel cmdline options to blacklist a little bit of Windows-specific BIOS code.
              <br>Try adding <span>acpi_osi=! acpi_osi="Windows 2012"</span>. Try with 2009 or 2015 instead for 9xxm and 20xx series respectively if it doesn't work.
